# DOOM-EMACS post-installation procedure

# <doom sync> to synchronize your private config with Doom by installing missing packages, removing orphaned packages, and regenerating caches. Run this whenever you modify your private init.el or packages.el, or install/remove an Emacs package through your OS package manager (e.g. mu4e or agda).
	$ doom sync

# doom upgrade> to update Doom to the latest release & all installed packages.
	$ doom upgrade

# <doom doctor> to diagnose common issues with your system and config.
	$ doom doctor

# <doom env> to dump a snapshot of your shell environment to a file that Doom will load at startup. This allows Emacs to inherit your PATH, among other things.
	$ doom env (this appears to point to ~/.doom.d)

# <doom build> to recompile all installed packages (use this if you up/downgrade Emacs.)
	$ doom build
